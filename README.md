# Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)

**ONDC** aims to democratize digital commerce by creating a decentralized network that connects buyer apps and seller apps through an interoperable protocol specification. This initiative supports a more inclusive digital commerce ecosystem.

## Overview

This guide is tailored for developers looking to integrate their digital commerce platforms with ONDC, facilitating seamless interoperability within a decentralized network. By integrating with ONDC, your platform can leverage a wider network, enabling more robust digital commerce transactions.

## üåü Introduction

The **Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)** is an innovative project launched to promote open networks developed on open-sourced methodology, using open specifications and open network protocols, independent of any specific platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The first step is to create an account on the [**ONDC Web Portal**](https://portal.ondc.org/), a comprehensive self-service platform that facilitates the interaction between ONDC and its network participants throughout their integration lifecycle.

## üåü Quick Start Guide

Explore the [**ONDC Integration Guide**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HPRXk3lVYKmyAFcApgukZuwHhIZ_VlqR/edit#slide=id.g27b2e3e34a2_28_199), a detailed roadmap highlighting key resources and steps required for a smooth integration process.

## üîó The Protocol

ONDC utilizes the **Beckn Protocol**‚Äîan open standard that enables local businesses across various industries to connect with beckn-enabled applications for seamless commercial transactions.

## üìú Subscription Process

Integration with ONDC involves several key stages, each requiring specific actions:

- **Staging Registry:** Begin by obtaining a subscriber ID and initiating the subscription process via the `/subscribe` API.The complete process is documented [**here**](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/developer-docs/blob/main/registry/Onboarding%20of%20Participants.md)
- **Pre-Production Registry:** After a successful demo, move to the pre-production stage as per the [**guidelines**](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/developer-docs/blob/main/registry/Onboarding%20of%20Participants.md).
- **Production Registry:** Upon passing functional testing, transition to the production environment.

## üñãÔ∏è Signing and Verification

When communicating over HTTP using Beckn APIs, the subscribers need to authenticate themselves to perform transactions with other subscribers. Due to the commercial nature of the transactions, every request/callback pair is considered to be a **contract** between two parties. Therefore, all requests and callbacks must be digitally signed by the sender and subsequently verified by the receiver.

The complete process is documented[**HERE**](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/developer-docs/blob/main/registry/signing-verification.md).
